              <p>
                We'll need some information about the requirements for your
                website. Once this stage has been completed, we will ask for
                payment to start the development process.<br />
                <strong>We typically ask for:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Website Colour Scheme (if applicable)</li>
                <li>Any assets for example: Images, Icons, Logos etc.</li>
                <li>Any designs you currently have for your website.</li>
                <li>
                  A description of your website's required functionality.
                </li>
                <li>Your email address for communications</li>

              <p>
                Before we start developing your website, we must first accept
                payment for your chosen pricing option for developing your
                website. Please note there may also be separate monthly charges
                for certain online services and ongoing maintenance fees; our
                team will tell you this during the requirements stage. All fees
                will also be on your invoice. You will not be charged for online
                services or maintenance until your website is being used by its
                end-users.
                <br />

                  >You may need to raise your daily transaction limit on your
                  bank account. We accept debit cards, credit cards, and bank
                  transfers as payment.</strong

              How Long Will Each Stage of the Development Process Take?

            <p class="faq-paragraph">
              This can vary based on the complexity of your website. However,
              generally it takes 1 week to write the requirements, 2 weeks for
              design, 2 weeks for development, and 3 weeks for testing. So, a
              total development time of 8 weeks (2 months). This also does not
              include non-working days like bank holidays and weekends.

            <p class="faq-paragraph">
              We offer free websites so you can get an idea of how the
              development process works and what our work looks like before
              committing to a paid plan. Therefore, if you like the work we have
              done, you can upgrade to a paid plan for additional features.

            <p class="faq-paragraph">
              Unfortunately, we do not accept customers outside of the UK.
              However, we are looking to expand into different countries in the
              future.
